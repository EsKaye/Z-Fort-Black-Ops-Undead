   - Implement WeaponComponent with ammo, damage, fire rate
   - Add weapon switching and inventory system
   - Create weapon factory for different weapon types

2. **UI System Development**:
   - Create UISystem.verse with component-based approach
   - Implement HUD components (health, ammo, wave info)
   - Add menu system with state management
   - Create UI event system for game events

3. **Sound & Visual Effects**:
   - Implement sound system with component architecture
   - Add visual effects system for explosions, impacts
   - Create particle system for zombie deaths, weapon effects

4. **Save/Load System**:
   - Implement save system for game progress
   - Add configuration saving for settings
   - Create load system for resuming games

### 💡 Ideas & Concepts

#### Gameplay Enhancements:
- **Perk System**: Implement Call of Duty style perks (Juggernog, Speed Cola, etc.)
- **Mystery Box**: Random weapon selection system
- **Power System**: Turn on power to unlock areas and features
- **Barricades**: Buildable defenses for strategic gameplay
- **Boss Events**: Special boss zombies every 10 waves

#### Technical Improvements:
- **Object Pooling**: For zombies, projectiles, and effects
- **Spatial Partitioning**: For efficient collision detection
- **Multiplayer Sync**: For cooperative gameplay
- **Achievement System**: Track player accomplishments
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed game statistics

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Update Batching**: Group similar updates together
- **LOD System**: Level of detail for distant objects
- **Culling**: Don't update off-screen entities
- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce allocations
- **Async Loading**: Load assets in background

### 🔧 Technical Notes

#### Component System Extensions:
```verse
# Need to add these components:
- AudioComponent: For sound effects and music
- VisualEffectComponent: For particles and effects
- InventoryComponent: For weapon and item management
- PerkComponent: For player perks and abilities
- NetworkComponent: For multiplayer synchronization
```

#### Event System Extensions:
```verse
# Need to add these events:
- WeaponFired
- AmmoChanged
- PerkActivated
- PowerActivated
- BossSpawned
- AchievementUnlocked
```

#### Performance Monitoring:
```verse
# Need to track:
- Frame rate
- Memory usage
- Entity count
- Update times
- Network latency (for multiplayer)
```

### 🎯 Architecture Decisions

#### Current Architecture:
- **Singleton Pattern**: For global managers (GameManager, SpawnerManager)
- **Component System**: For entity behavior (Unity-style)
- **Event System**: For loose coupling between systems
- **Factory Pattern**: For entity creation
- **State Machine**: For game and entity states

#### Planned Extensions:
- **Observer Pattern**: For UI updates
- **Command Pattern**: For input handling
- **Strategy Pattern**: For AI behaviors
- **Decorator Pattern**: For weapon modifications
- **Builder Pattern**: For complex entity creation

### 📊 Performance Targets

#### Current Performance:
- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS
- **Max Entities**: 100 zombies + 4 players
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB
- **Load Times**: < 5 seconds

#### Optimization Goals:
- **Entity Pooling**: Reduce object creation/destruction
- **Update Optimization**: Only update visible/active entities
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and pooling
- **Network Optimization**: Efficient multiplayer sync

### 🐛 Known Issues & TODOs

#### Current Issues:
1. **Game Time Implementation**: Need proper time tracking system
2. **Random Number Generation**: Need proper RNG implementation
3. **Pathfinding**: Need proper pathfinding algorithm
4. **Collision Detection**: Need efficient collision system
5. **UI Integration**: Need to connect UI to game systems

#### Technical Debt:
1. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling
2. **Input Validation**: Need input validation throughout
3. **Documentation**: Need more inline documentation
4. **Testing**: Need unit tests for core systems
5. **Logging**: Need proper logging system

### 🎮 Game Design Notes

#### Core Gameplay Loop:
1. **Wave Start**: Spawn zombies based on wave number
2. **Combat**: Players fight zombies, earn points
3. **Wave End**: Clear all zombies, award bonus
4. **Preparation**: Buy weapons, perks, build defenses
5. **Repeat**: Next wave with increased difficulty

#### Progression System:
- **Points**: Earned by killing zombies
- **Waves**: Increasing difficulty and zombie count
- **Weapons**: Unlock better weapons with points
- **Perks**: Purchase temporary abilities
- **Achievements**: Long-term goals and rewards

#### Balance Considerations:
- **Zombie Health**: Scales with wave number
- **Zombie Speed**: Varies by type
- **Spawn Rate**: Increases with wave number
- **Weapon Damage**: Must keep pace with zombie health
- **Point Economy**: Balance earning vs spending
