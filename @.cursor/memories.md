# ðŸ§  Project Memories

## Project Initialization
- Created initial project structure
- Set up core documentation
- Created basic Verse scripts for GameManager, WaveSystem, and PointsSystem

## Core Systems Implemented
### Game Management
- Basic game state management
- Wave progression system
- Points and economy system

### Wave System
- Wave configuration and progression
- Zombie spawning mechanics
- Difficulty scaling

### Points System
- Points accumulation
- Economy management
- Resource tracking

### Exo Movement System
- Advanced movement mechanics inspired by Black Ops 3
- Double jump functionality
- Wall running system
- Sliding mechanics
- Boost dash ability
- Hover capability
- Movement state management
- Input handling and integration

## Next Steps
- Implement zombie AI
- Create weapon system
- Design perk system
- Set up building system
- Create UI elements
- Implement wall detection and collision
- Add movement animations and effects
- Create movement tutorial system

## Technical Decisions
- Using Verse for game logic
- Object pooling for performance
- Event-driven architecture
- Modular system design
- State-based movement system
- Configurable movement parameters

## Challenges & Solutions
- Directory structure creation on Windows
  - Solution: Created directories one by one
- Initial system architecture
  - Solution: Implemented modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Movement system complexity
  - Solution: Created separate movement and controller classes
  - Implemented state machine for movement states
  - Added configuration system for easy tuning

## Notes
- Need to implement zombie spawning
- Need to connect UI system
- Need to add more zombie types
- Consider special events
- Need to implement wall detection
- Need to add movement animations
- Consider adding movement tutorial
