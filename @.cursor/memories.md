# Z-Fort Black Ops Undead - AI Memories & Session Tracking

## Session History & Progress Tracking

### Current Session: Major Refactoring Implementation
**Date:** December 2024
**Focus:** Complete system refactoring using Unity best practices

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. **GameManager Refactoring** âœ…
   - Implemented Unity-style singleton pattern
   - Added comprehensive event-driven architecture
   - Enhanced state management with proper state transitions
   - Added performance tracking and real-time updates
   - Implemented proper player management system

2. **Component-Based Architecture** âœ…
   - Created comprehensive ComponentSystem.verse
   - Implemented Unity-style GameObject and Component classes
   - Added HealthComponent, MovementComponent, WeaponComponent
   - Created ComponentFactory for easy component creation
   - Established proper component lifecycle management

3. **Zombie Entity Refactoring** âœ…
   - Created ZombieRefactored.verse using component architecture
   - Implemented ZombieHealthComponent with stun mechanics
   - Added ZombieMovementComponent with pathfinding
   - Created ZombieAIComponent for intelligent behavior
   - Implemented ZombieFactory for easy zombie creation
   - Added support for different zombie types (Basic, Runner, Brute, Elemental, Boss)

4. **Spawner System Refactoring** âœ…
   - Created ZombieSpawnerRefactored.verse
   - Implemented weighted spawn system
   - Added spawn point management
   - Created SpawnerManager for multiple spawner coordination
   - Added performance tracking and statistics

#### Technical Improvements:
- **Modularity:** All systems now use component-based architecture
- **Performance:** Improved update loops and memory management
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new zombie types and behaviors
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven:** Proper event system for loose coupling

#### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Singleton Pattern:** Used for GameManager and SpawnerManager
2. **Component System:** Unity-style component attachment
3. **Factory Pattern:** For creating entities and components
4. **Event System:** For communication between systems
5. **State Machine:** For managing game and entity states

#### Next Steps:
1. Refactor weapon system using component architecture
2. Implement UI system with component-based approach
3. Add sound and visual effects systems
4. Create save/load system
5. Implement multiplayer synchronization

#### Lessons Learned:
- Component-based architecture greatly improves code organization
- Event-driven systems reduce coupling between components
- Factory patterns make entity creation more flexible
- Proper state management prevents bugs and improves performance

#### Code Quality Standards:
- All new code follows Unity best practices
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Proper error handling and validation
- Performance considerations in all systems
- Clear naming conventions and structure

#### Documentation Status:
- âœ… GameManager documentation updated
- âœ… Component system documented
- âœ… Zombie system documented
- âœ… Spawner system documented
- ðŸ”„ Need to update README and architecture docs

#### Performance Metrics:
- Reduced coupling between systems
- Improved memory usage through component pooling
- Better update loop efficiency
- Scalable architecture for large numbers of entities

#### Security Considerations:
- Input validation in all public methods
- Proper access control for component methods
- Safe event handling to prevent crashes
- Memory leak prevention through proper cleanup

## Technical Decisions
- Using Verse for game logic
- Object pooling for performance
- Event-driven architecture
- Modular system design
- State-based movement system
- Configurable movement parameters

## Challenges & Solutions
- Directory structure creation on Windows
  - Solution: Created directories one by one
