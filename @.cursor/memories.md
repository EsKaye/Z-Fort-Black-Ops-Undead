# ðŸ§  Project Memories

## Project Initialization
- Created initial project structure
- Set up core documentation
- Implemented basic Verse scripts for:
  - GameManager
  - WaveSystem
  - PointsSystem

## Core Systems Implemented
1. **Game Management**
   - Wave progression
   - Player tracking
   - Game state management

2. **Wave System**
   - Wave configuration
   - Zombie spawning
   - Difficulty scaling

3. **Points System**
   - Economy management
   - Purchase system
   - Point multipliers

## Next Steps
1. Implement zombie AI and behavior
2. Create weapon system
3. Design and implement perks
4. Set up building system
5. Create UI elements

## Technical Decisions
- Using Verse for game logic
- Implementing object pooling for performance
- Using event-driven architecture
- Modular system design

## Challenges & Solutions
- Directory structure creation on Windows
  - Solution: Created directories individually
- Initial system architecture
  - Solution: Implemented core systems first

## Notes
- Need to implement actual zombie spawning
- UI system needs to be connected
- Need to add more zombie types
- Consider adding more special events
